This feature is to create a trivial-to-implement, full featured immersive experience for viewing media like images and videos. For example, users can tap on an inline image in the page image (or button to trigger the same experience)—the image expands to full screen with a black scrim behind it, and overlayed affordances to exit the view, to view a related caption, to trigger a grid view to access other media in a given group/carousel in the same immersive view, or to hide the overlays to just view the complete media item.",
